# Data-Cleaning-Project
The SQL script follows a structured approach to clean and preprocess the data, which is stored in a staging table (layoffs_staging). The cleaned data is then moved to a new table (layoffs_staging2). The key steps include:

Removing duplicate records.
Standardizing values in key columns like company, industry, and country.
Handling missing or null values.
Renaming and restructuring tables to store cleaned data.
